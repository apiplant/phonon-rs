/**
 * The published release and its assets.
 *
 * `release.yml` builds one archive per target and names it
 * `phonon-rs-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz` (plus a separate CUDA-enabled
 * `phonon-rs-cuda-<tag>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`), so a direct link
 * can be assembled here rather than sending every reader to the releases
 * page to hunt for their own. The version comes from the crate manifest at
 * build time, which means a site deployed from a commit predating the tag
 * would link at an asset that does not exist yet — deploy the site after the
 * release, not before.
