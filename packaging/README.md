# Packaging

One package, `phonon-rs`, carrying `phonon`, `phonon-dictate`.
The `packages`, `homebrew`, `apt` and `pacman` jobs in
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) substitute
the `@VERSION@`, `@SHA_*@` and `@ARCH@` placeholders with the tag's version and
the checksums of the archives that release just built, then publish the
result. None of the definitions compiles the project from source — they all
install the binaries the build jobs already produced, which is what keeps the
packages and the release byte-identical.

| File | Publishes to |
| --- | --- |
| `homebrew/phonon-rs.rb` | `apiplant/homebrew-tap`, as `Formula/phonon-rs.rb` |
| `homebrew/phonon-rs-cuda.rb` | `apiplant/homebrew-tap`, as `Formula/phonon-rs-cuda.rb` |
| `pacman/PKGBUILD` | the release itself, as a `.pkg.tar.zst` asset, and `apiplant/pacman` |
| `debian/control` | the release itself, as `.deb` assets, and `apiplant/apt` |
| `apt/apt-ftparchive.conf` | `apiplant/apt`, served at `apt.apiplant.com` |
| `pacman/PKGBUILD-cuda` | the release itself, and `apiplant/pacman` |
| `debian/control-cuda` | the release itself, and `apiplant/apt` |

This repository reuses the shared `apiplant` repositories that already serve
`gliner-rs`, `laya-rs`, `nvidia-smi-live`, `portward` and `megadl-rs` —
`apiplant/homebrew-tap`, `apiplant/pacman` (served at
`apiplant.github.io/pacman`) and `apiplant/apt` (served at `apt.apiplant.com`)
— rather than standing up new ones. The same repository secrets those releases
use (`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, `PACMAN_REPO_TOKEN` +
`PACMAN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`/`PACMAN_GPG_PASSPHRASE`, `APT_REPO_TOKEN` +
`APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`/`APT_GPG_PASSPHRASE`) work here unchanged. They are copied
here by the `Sync release secrets` workflow in `apiplant/gliner-rs`; run it
once (with `dry_run` off) if this repository doesn't have them yet. A publish
job whose credential is absent is skipped rather than failing the release, so
a fork — or this repository before the secrets are copied — still gets a clean
release.

## Platform matrix

| Platform | How it ships |
| --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon, `aarch64-apple-darwin`) | archive + Homebrew formula |
| Linux x86_64 (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`) | archive, `.deb` + apt repo, Arch package + pacman repo, Homebrew formula |
| Linux x86_64, CUDA (`--features cuda`) | archive, `.deb` + apt repo, Arch package + pacman repo, Homebrew formula (`-cuda`) |
| Linux aarch64 (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) | archive, `.deb` + apt repo, Homebrew formula |

The Arch package is x86_64 only: it would need an arm runner or emulation to
build, and the Arch repository has no aarch64 audience. The `.deb`, the apt
repo and the plain archive still cover Linux arm64.

The CUDA build (`phonon-rs-cuda-<tag>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`) is compiled
in the `cuda-binary` job, in an `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-devel-ubuntu22.04` container — that gives
`nvcc` and the CUDA headers/stub libraries the build needs, without needing an
actual GPU on the runner. It also ships as `phonon-rs-cuda`, a separate `.deb`
(`packaging/debian/control-cuda`), Arch package (`packaging/pacman/PKGBUILD-cuda`)
and Homebrew formula (`packaging/homebrew/phonon-rs-cuda.rb`, Linux x86_64 only),
published to the same repositories as the CPU build. Needs an NVIDIA GPU (Turing or newer).

None of these can express "needs a host NVIDIA driver compatible with this CUDA
toolkit version" precisely — the `.deb` depends on `libcuda1`, the Arch package
on `nvidia-utils`, and the Homebrew formula cannot depend on a driver at all —
so a user installing the CUDA package still needs to have a compatible driver.
All of them conflict with (and provide) `phonon-rs`, since they install the same
binary names and only one build can be on a system at a time. There is no
aarch64 or macOS CUDA build: no CUDA on Apple Silicon, and no arm64 CUDA
audience to justify the extra job.

The order is: build every archive, build the distro packages from those
archives, publish the release, then publish to Homebrew, apt and pacman — the
formula, apt pool and PKGBUILD all reference (or are built from) the archives
that release holds, and the GitHub release should exist first so the URLs they
link stay valid.

## Cutting a release

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, commit, then:

```bash
git tag v$(grep -m1 '^version' Cargo.toml | cut -d'"' -f2) && git push origin --tags
```

`workflow_dispatch` runs the build and packaging jobs without publishing
anything (a dry run).

## Using the packages

macOS (Apple Silicon) and Linux, via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap apiplant/tap
brew install apiplant/tap/phonon-rs          # or phonon-rs-cuda on Linux x86_64
```

Arch Linux, via the signed pacman repository at `apiplant.github.io/pacman`
(one-time setup, then `pacman -Sy`/`-Syu` picks up new releases):

```bash
curl -sSfL https://apiplant.github.io/pacman/apiplant.gpg -o /tmp/apiplant.gpg
keyid=$(gpg --show-keys --with-colons /tmp/apiplant.gpg | awk -F: '/^pub:/ { print $5; exit }') && sudo pacman-key --add /tmp/apiplant.gpg && sudo pacman-key --finger "$keyid" && sudo pacman-key --lsign-key "$keyid"
printf '\n[apiplant]\nSigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional\nServer = https://apiplant.github.io/pacman/$arch\n' | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf > /dev/null
sudo pacman -Sy phonon-rs
```

Debian/Ubuntu, via the signed apt repository at `apt.apiplant.com` (one-time
setup, then `apt upgrade` picks up new releases):

```bash
curl -sSfL https://apt.apiplant.com/apiplant-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/apiplant.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/apiplant.gpg] https://apt.apiplant.com stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apiplant.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install phonon-rs
```

Or install a single `.deb`/`.pkg.tar.zst` release asset directly without adding
a repository:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i phonon-rs_*_amd64.deb
sudo pacman -U phonon-rs-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Or download and unpack the archive for your platform from the release page — no
installation required.
